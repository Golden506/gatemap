1. ~Develop logic gate library~
    * ~Coding~
    * ~Learn about implementation~
    * ~Actually implement~
2. Develop text based logic interface
    * Set up CLI to create and link gates
    * Set up code to generate actual code(using logic gate library) based off of gates user has created and linked
    * Set up switches for base wire(turning on/off input wires)
3. Develop graphical interface
    * Allow gates and wires to be mapped onto coordinate plane(wires can overlap but gates cannot)
    * Program GUI to work with creation/linking code written earlier
    * Allow wires to be connected by dragging from one gate to another
